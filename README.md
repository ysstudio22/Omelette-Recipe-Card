# What I learned

My goal was to design the mobile view first then then the desktop view.  Using the style guide, I got the breakpoints for the site.

Along the way there were a couple of hurdles to overcome, which ended up in me doing a lot of research.  Despite the amount of time I had to spend researching, I learned quite a bit about lists and making tables.  The one that surprised me the most was the ordered lists and what could be done to achieve the result as seen in the screenshot above.

In addition too styling challenges, I struggled with adding the media queries and making the adjustments to the mobile components I had built before.  One thing that helped was to nest the media query so that I can what I've done with the mobile view.

# Moving Forward

This challenge allowed me to deal with creating responsive sites.  Having completed this challenge, I'd like to try building other responsive sites to see if I could be efficient from start to finish.
